\section{Introduction}
A complaint amongst older people is that they are bored or lonely; they miss the social interaction younger people naturally have from sport, work or school. In this report, we discuss a system which tries to enhance the life of elderly by providing them with entertainment and by helping them with their social life. The system is designed for use in old peoples homes. The system is aimed to respect privacy and the needed rest of the elderly and is equipped with a user-friendly interface.

The system reduces the boredom en loneliness of the elderly by providing them with user-based entertainment. [EXPLANATION OF MEDIA]

Furthermore, the system enhances the social life of the elderly by planning several social activities for the elderly based on their personal needs. [TYPES OF ACTIVITIES?]

The systems user interface will be provided by several media like touch-screen tables and tablets. Considering the inconformity of the elderly with present-day technology the user interface will be based on simplicity. This simplicity will be outed in a few large buttons and intuitive 

The system adapts to every user by gathering a lot of data about the person, both about his life history, interests and family and about his interactions with the system. As an example, the system tries to recognize patterns in which type of entertainment a person in most pleased with and on which occasions. Through large amounts of data, the system gets to know each user and behaves appropriately.
